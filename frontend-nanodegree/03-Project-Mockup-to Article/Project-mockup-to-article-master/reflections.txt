1. I’ve learnt HTML syntax, how the tags work and how I should use them, how the tree-HTML works, how to translate a simple mockup to HTML 
2. It’s easy to find online each tag I should be using and the classes are very clear.
3. I keep forgetting to close the tags
4. I re-watch the lessons, I’m searching and reading on the links the teacher gave and keep asking questions to my friends
