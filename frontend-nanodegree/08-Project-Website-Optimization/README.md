# Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

This is the final project of the 8th part of the Front-End Web Developer nanodegree at Udacity. In this project, I optimized this website that initially had a number of optimization and performance-related issues. Fixed that and achieved a target PageSpeed score over 90 and it runs at 60 frames per second. Showcased here are some of my past projects done during this nanodegree :) 

##Portfolio page

1. To make the index.html faster I optimized the CSS, HTML and the images displayed on this page.

2. Checked on PageSpeed Insights all the changes to know where I should focus. To check on Page Insights I created a local server and using NGrok made it accessible remotely. 

##Pizza page

1. To optimize the Pizza Pizza, I worked on its Javascript file main.js

2. I found where a "for loop" that weren't necessary for the page and was creating a bottleneck. I changed the code and it started running on the expected way.
