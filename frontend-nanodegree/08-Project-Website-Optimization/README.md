# Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

This is the final project of the 8th part of the Front-End Web Developer nanodegree at Udacity. In this project, I optimized this website that initially had a number of optimization and performance-related issues. Fixed that and achieved a target PageSpeed score over 90 and it runs at 60 frames per second. Showcased here are some of my past projects done during this nanodegree :) 

## Open the Project

Please, check the live website [here](https://fernandanauata.github.io/Courses/frontend-nanodegree/08-Project-Website-Optimization).

Or clone this file on your local computer and open the `index.html` file on your browser.


##Portfolio page

1. To make the index.html faster I optimized the CSS, HTML and the images displayed on this page.

2. Checked on PageSpeed Insights all the changes to know where I should focus. To check on Page Insights I created a local server and using NGrok made it accessible remotely. 

##Pizza page

1. To optimize the Pizza Pizza, I worked on its Javascript file main.js

2. I found where a "for loop" that weren't necessary for the page and was creating a bottleneck. I changed the code and it started running the expected way. 

3. Changed the Web API calls to faster ones. 

4. Declare variables outside the loop when I could so they would only have one DOM call

5. Changed the number of pizzas on the background to less so we would only have enough to the screen size.
