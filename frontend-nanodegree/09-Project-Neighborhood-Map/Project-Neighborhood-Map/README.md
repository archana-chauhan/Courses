## Project Neighborhood Map

This web application was built using Knockout JS, Google Maps API, Translink API, Javascript, HTML and CSS.

The Map, markers and info windows are created asynchronous, I collected the information from the Translink `Ajax` and appended the bus stop names when a button is clicked.

The bus stops were added creating an `array` from a JSON and using a control flow structure to display them all. The `foreach function` duplicated my `<li>` markup for each entry of the bus stops array.
