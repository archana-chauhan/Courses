## Cat Clicker made using Knockout JS

This web application was built using Knockout JS. I've created a `ViewModel function` and added the information to be displayed. There is click count function the increases the number over the cat every time you click the image. The nicknames were added using the `foreach function` on the `data-bind` attribute.
