## Cat Clicker made using Knockout JS

This web application was built using Knockout JS. I've created a `ViewModel function` and added the information to be displayed. There is click count function the increases the number over the cat every time you click the image. The nicknames were added creating an `array` and using a control flow structure to display them all. The `foreach function` duplicated my `<li>` markup for each entry of the nickname array.

You can change the cat on the left list, this list was built using the `foreach function` and `click bind`, it accesses the parameter of the clicked cat and passes it to a function that updates the current cat.
