## Cat Clicker made using Knockout JS

This web application was built using Knockout JS. I've created a `ViewModel function` and added the information to be displayed. There is click count function the increases the number over the cat every time you click the image. The nicknames were added creating a `array` and using a control flow structure to display them all. The `foreach function` duplicated my `<li>` markup for each entry of the nickname array.
